Groupoid Infinity
=================

The Groupoid Infinity Cubical Base Library is dedicated to [cubical](https://github.com/mortberg/cubicaltt)-compatible
typecheckers based on homotopy interval <b>[0,1]</b> and MLTT as a core.
The library follows HoTT foundation and mathematics partitioning: the `Foundations`
chapter covers the very basics of the cubical programming language; the `Mathematics`
chapter covers the formal mathematics library of models and theorems.
This library is best to read with HoTT book at http://groupoid.space/math/
